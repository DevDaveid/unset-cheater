# Unset Cheater

### Purpose
Unsets players as cheaters that are globally banned from your GOKZ server.

### Usage
Add to your plugins folder and run ``sm plugins load unsetcheater``. If you want all players joining your server to be unset as cheaters then run the plugin without a config file. If you however only want a few select players to count as non-cheaters then you need to create ``configs/unsetcheaters.cfg`` and add their SteamID's to it like shown below.
